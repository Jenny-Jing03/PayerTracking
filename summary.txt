I chose to use Java as my project's programming language because it is my primary and most familiar language. I used Spring Boot as my framework, which also is my most familiar framework in Java Web development. In addition, Spring Boot provides convenient models for security, data management, and so on. 
One of the benefits of my design is high sustainability. In my design, adding other functions, such as authentication, is easy and convenient. In addition, my design is friendly to the database. Avoiding deleting data in the database is one of my designs, which can keep all the transaction information and maintain the stability and complexity of the database. However, there are also some disadvantages to my design. In my database, I stored all transaction data into a single table. For an actual application, there will be thousands of transactions. If I apply this design in actual application, the time complexity of finding the data will be hard, because of the large scale of data. 
One of the most challenging projects that I did was a web-based software purchase application with React and GO. I had to construct the frames and features with GO, which is an unfamiliar language for me. Moreover, it is my second web-based project. I still spent some time managing the data transmission. I prioritized the work and set some check points and deadlines for myself, so I finished the project in two months. Although this is not a profitable application, I still felt proud of myself, because I fixed all the bus and generated a workable application.
